# ORIGINS — Attribution of Imported Material

**Last updated:** 2026-05-17 (bootstrap P3)
**Branch:** development
**Scribe:** Eirwyn Rúnblóm (working through Runa Gridweaver Freyjasdottir)
**Scope:** Every root-level file and every top-level directory present in this repository, with a best-effort judgement of which prior project — or none — it came from, the evidence supporting that judgement, and honest marking of uncertainty.
**Purpose:** Give the integration phase a clean starting point. Decisions about keep / merge / remove / re-home are made on known ground rather than guesswork.

## How to read this register

| Column | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Item** | The file or folder being attributed. |
| **Origin** | The prior project or domain the material is judged to come from. Sources used: *fresh* (written specifically for this repository), the canonical [Mythic Engineering repo](https://github.com/hrabanazviking/Mythic-Engineering), Volmarr's cross-project writings, Volmarr's cross-project AI ecosystem docs, or another named Volmarr project (NSE, MindSpark, WYRD, VGSK, HERETIC, Seidr-Smidja, MV CLI, Rune Forge AI). |
| **Evidence** | What the judgement is based on: import commit hash and message, content reference, known shared docs across repos. |
| **Confidence** | High / Medium / Low. Honest about uncertainty. |
| **Status** | What was done with it in the 2026-05-17 bootstrap: *keep-at-root*, *moved-to-X*, *replaced-by-Y*, *removed*, *renamed-to-Z*. |
| **Notes** | Anything else worth recording. |

If a row's Confidence is **Low**, the entry should be reviewed by Volmarr or by a future contributor with better knowledge of the source ecosystem and updated.

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `HERMES_OPENCLAW_DESIGN_ANTI_PATTERNS.md` | Hermes / OpenClaw context (likely from Mythic Vibe CLI period) | Commit `b42d373`. 25 KB anti-pattern register from earlier work on Hermes and OpenClaw. | Medium | moved-to-docs/decisions/ | Acts as informal lessons-learned the early ADRs will cite. |

### 1.7 Configuration scaffolding

## 2. Images at root (originally — moved to `assets/` in P5)

| Item | Origin | Evidence | Confidence | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `057d8120-...jpg`, `11e7f20c-...jpg`, `2d1bd1cd-...jpg`, `5b9f7f69-...jpg` | likely AI-generated Runa illustrations | Commit `58f82e9` "Add files via upload" (GitHub web upload). UUID filenames typical of generative-image output. Referenced from `README.md` as Runa illustrations. | Medium-High | moved-to-assets/ | Descriptive renaming deferred to a later pass. |
| `09049c21-...jpg`, `2fbebd4c-...jpg`, `5f0a44c1-...jpg`, `c855b5d6-...jpg` | likely AI-generated Runa illustrations | Commit `f843b9f` (second upload). Same provenance pattern. | Medium-High | moved-to-assets/ | |
| `IMG_0665.jpeg`, `IMG_0666.jpeg` | likely Volmarr-camera or screenshot dump | Commit `d71eeda`. `IMG_NNNN.jpeg` filenames typical of iOS/camera default naming. | Medium | moved-to-assets/ | |
| `MIT_license_Rune_Forge_AI.jpeg` | Rune Forge AI — **confirmed separate Volmarr project** (resolved 2026-05-17 by Volmarr; see ADR 0002 §D-2.7) | Commit `d71eeda`. 418 KB. | High | moved-to-assets/ | Sibling repo to NSE / WYRD / MindSpark / etc. Repository URL and status to be added to memory when surfaced. Used as an illustrative reference to a licensing artifact; not the legal license itself (which is `LICENSE`). |

## 3. Top-level directories (created during bootstrap)

All directories below were created in commit `22cd6c5` (P1+P2). Origin is *bootstrap*: they did not exist before the Mythic Engineering Sacred Setup. Each carries its own `README.md` explaining purpose.

| Directory | Purpose summary |
|---|---|
| `docs/` | All written material. Subfolders: `architecture/`, `operations/`, `development/`, `design/`, `security/`, `adapters/`, `plugins/`, `decisions/`, `philosophy/`, `methodology/`, `archive/`. |
| `config/` | Configuration templates and examples (never live runtime config). |
| `src/runa/` | The Python implementation. Subpackages: `cli/`, `runtime/`, `core/`, `services/`, `apps/`, `adapters/`, `plugins/`, `skills/`, `schemas/`, `migrations/`. |
| `tests/` | Automated verification — `unit/`, `integration/`, `e2e/`, `fixtures/`, `snapshots/`. |
| `scripts/` | Human-invoked helpers — `dev/`, `maintenance/`, `one_shot/`. |
| `deploy/` | Deployment manifests — `systemd/`, `docker/`, `pi/`, `examples/`. |
| `tools/` | Repo-tooling and live-diagnostics — `repo/`, `diagnostics/`, `importers/`. |
| `examples/` | Reference configs, sessions, skills, plugins. |
| `vendor/` | Third-party code that lives inside the repo (currently empty). |
| `assets/` | Binary and media files referenced from documentation. |

---

## 4. Files created during bootstrap

| File | Created in commit | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `TASK_runa_bootstrap.md` | `f437a29` (P0) | Resumption anchor for this multi-phase bootstrap. May or may not be removed at P12 — Volmarr decides. |
| All `README.md` under directories | `22cd6c5` (P1+P2) | Per-directory purpose statements that double as `.gitkeep` equivalents. |
| `ORIGINS.md` (this file) | (P3 commit, in progress) | This attribution register. |

## 5. Open uncertainties — flagged for future review

1. ~~**`Runa-Agent-Digital-Being.md` vs `Runa_Agent_Digital_Being.md`** (kebab vs snake case). Both were added within 3 minutes of each other on 2026-05-17, both are large (48 KB / 65 KB), both look like canonical agent design drafts. They may be near-duplicates, alternate drafts, or genuinely complementary. **Action:** diff and reconcile in a later session before either is treated as authoritative.~~ **Resolved 2026-05-17 by Volmarr:** the two files are *different documents written by different AI models with intentionally similar names*. They are not duplicates and must not be reconciled or merged. They stand side by side in `docs/architecture/` as parallel design articulations.

2. ~~**`MIT_license_Rune_Forge_AI.jpeg` provenance**. The "Rune Forge AI" project is not currently in Runa's local project memory. Likely an earlier or sibling Volmarr project; confirm with Volmarr what it is and whether the image should stay.~~ **Resolved 2026-05-17 by Volmarr:** Rune Forge AI is a separate Volmarr project (sibling to NSE / WYRD / MindSpark). See ADR 0002 §D-2.7. The image stays. Repository URL and status to be added to memory when Volmarr surfaces them.

3. **The two README-update bursts** (commits `3322de4` through `5d26d2c`) suggest the README was iteratively grown during the initial publishing day. The current 41 KB form is what `P9` polishes; the iteration history itself is preserved in git log but is not explicitly mapped here.

4. **Photo images `IMG_0665.jpeg` / `IMG_0666.jpeg`**: source device and subject not recorded. Likely Volmarr photography or screenshots; confirm before they are referenced from any user-facing doc.

5. **Image filenames** are all UUIDs or camera-default `IMG_NNNN`. They were not renamed during this bootstrap. A future pass should give them descriptive names that match how they are used in the documentation.

## 5b. Reconciliation log

### 2026-05-17 — `b57a241` merge-from-main brought back 4 root images

While the bootstrap was in progress on `development`, Volmarr uploaded 4 images to `main` (commit `811b132`, 2026-05-17 02:24) and then merged `main` into `development` (`b57a241`, 02:49) — bringing the 4 images back to the repository root.

The 4 images (`09049c21-...jpg`, `2fbebd4c-...jpg`, `5f0a44c1-...jpg`, `c855b5d6-...jpg`) were already present at `assets/` from P5 (commit `166d00f`). Byte-diff confirmed the merged-in root copies were identical to the `assets/` copies. The root copies were removed in the following commit (no information lost — `assets/` retains the working copy and `README.md` already references the relative `./assets/<name>` paths after P5's URL rewrite). Volmarr's merge commit itself remains in history.

**Lesson:** if Volmarr touches `main` separately during a bootstrap, a similar merge can re-introduce material that has been re-homed on `development`. The drift-detector planned for `tools/repo/check_origins_drift.py` should flag this case (file present at root that is also present at `assets/`).

---

## 6. Maintenance rules for this file

- This file is **append-only in spirit**. When new material is imported, add a row. When status changes (a moved doc gets superseded), update the Status column with the date but do not remove the row.
- If a Confidence rating later proves wrong, change it to **High** or **Low** as appropriate and add a Notes-line dated entry explaining what made it change.
- A drift-detector under `tools/repo/check_origins_drift.py` is planned: it will flag any root file or top-level directory that exists in the repo but is not represented here, and any row here whose file no longer exists.
